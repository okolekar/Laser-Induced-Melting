title = {An enthalpy-temperature hybrid method for solving phase-change
problems and its application to polymer pyrolysis and ignition},
journal = {Combustion Theory and Modelling},
abstract = {A numerical approach based on the enthalpy method is proposed for solving generalized phase-change problems. The method is applied to predict pyrolysis and ignition of polymeric combustible materials. In contrast to the traditional approach, here both enthalpy and temperature are treated as independent variables, and the conservation equations are solved simultaneously in conjunction with the constitutive equations. Also, the formulation of the constitutive equations for the phase change is not necessarily the same for all of the possible phases, but can be chosen independently according to the characteristics of the physical problem and the requirements of the numerical analysis of each respective phase. Thus with this new approach, which we refer to as the enthalpy-temperature hybrid method, the enthalpy method is applicable to the generalized phase-change problems regardless of the form of the constitutive equations. The proposed method is first applied to a one-dimensional classical freezing problem for verification. It is found that the numerical results for the temperature history and the position of the phase-change interface agree well with the analytic solution existing in the literature. The method is then applied to the numerical simulation of the pyrolysis and ignition of a composite material with a polymer as the matrix and fibreglass as the filling material. Three models of oxygen distribution in the molten layer are considered to explore the melting and oxygen effects on the polymer pyrolysis. Numerical calculation shows that high oxygen concentrations in the molten layer enhance the pyrolysis reaction, resulting in a larger amount of pyrolysate, but in lower surface temperatures of the sample. It also shows that the distribution of oxygen in the molten layer has a strong effect on the pyrolysate rate, and therefore on ignition and combustion of the polymers. Comparison with available experimental data indicates that a model of oxygen distribution in the molten layer that is limited to a thin layer near the surface best describes the ignition process for a homogeneously blended polypropylene/fibreglass composite.}

title = {Investigation of transport phenomena and defect formation in pulsed laser keyhole welding of zinc-coated steels},
journal = {Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics},
abstract = {Lasers are being used to weld zinc-coated steels due to high welding speed, high aspect ratio, and narrow heat affected zone. However, escape of high-pressure zinc vapour in the welding process can damage the weld pool continuity and cause large voids and serious undercuts in the final welds. In this paper, a mathematical model and the associated numerical techniques have been developed to study the transport phenomena and defect formation mechanisms in pulsed laser keyhole welding of zinc-coated steels. The volume-of-fluid (VOF) method is employed to track free surfaces. The continuum model is used to handle the liquid phase, the solid phase and the mushy zone of the metal. The enthalpy method is employed to account for the latent heat during melting and solidification. The transient heat transfer and melt flow in the weld pool during the keyhole formation and collapse processes are calculated. The escape of zinc vapour through the keyhole and the interaction between zinc vapour and weld pool are studied. Voids in the welds are found to be caused by the combined effects of zinc vapour–melt interactions, keyhole collapse and solidification process. By controlling the laser pulse profile, it is found that the keyhole collapse and solidification process can be delayed, allowing the zinc vapour to escape, which results in the reduction or elimination of voids. The good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental observations indicates that the proposed model lays a solid foundation for future study of laser welding of zinc-coated steels.}
